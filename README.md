# FE2OG_project_draft
## Computational pipeline to identify structural landmarks that would distinguish different chemical schemes among FE2OG enzyme superfamily
Still under development. Contents are rather prliminary.

General Pipeline:
1. Retrieve a complete list of FE2OG enzymes;
2. Obtain corresponding sequence homologs;
3. Perform sequence clustering and deal with unwanted clusters;
4. Find the equivalent site around active center for each of the clusters;
5. Run PCA and alternatives to separate clusters based on the equivalent sites.
